# Bootstrap-Cross-Validation-Best-Subset-Selection-in-R

Task 1
- The dataset consists of GPA and ACT score of 120 freshmen in college.
- Implemented bootstrap to get 95% confidendece intervals.
- Fitted a simple linear regression model for predicting GPA based on the ACT score
- Repeated the above using nonparametric bootstrap to compute the standard errors and to get 95% confidence intervals

Task 2
- The dataset consists of information about Orange Juice purchases (between Minute Maid and Citrus Hill)
- Applied Linear Discrimimant Analysis (LDA) to get confusion matrix, sensitivity, and specificity using 10-fold cross-validation
- Repeated above using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Repeated above using KNN with K chosen optimall using 10-fold cross-validation
- Repeated agove using logistic regression

Task 3
- The dataset consists of Gas mileage, horsepower, and other information for 392 vehicles.
- Fitted a multiple linear regression model using the least squares method
- Applied best-subset selection to find the best model
- Repeated above using forward stepwise selection
- Repeated agove using backward stepwise selection
